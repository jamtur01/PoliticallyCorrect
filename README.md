# Politically correct

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of [ 'politically correct',
'political correctness', 'political correctness gone mad' ] with
'treating other people with respect'.

The extension was written as a result of Neil Gaimen's [excellent
post](http://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/43087620460/i-was-reading-a-book-about-interjections-oddly)
on how political correctness is actually just treating other people like
with respect.

## Installation

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions or navigate to
`chrome://extensions/`.  Drag `PoliticallyCorrect.crx` into the page that
appears.
